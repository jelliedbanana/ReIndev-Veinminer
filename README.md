# ReIndev-Veinminer
Simple veinminer mod for ReIndev v2.8.1

To veinmine, sneak while breaking a block with the appropriate tool and you'll break the whole vein at once!
You can also veinmine trees with an axe, clay and gravel with a shovel, and if you want, you can whitelist any block yourself.

# Whitelisting
This mod adds the command `/veinminewhitelist <add/remove> <block name>`

You will have to type the block's internal namespace id in order to whitelist it.

To mitigate the inconvenience of finding the exact name of your desired block, I made the command compatible with [my autocomplete mod!](https://github.com/jelliedbanana/ReIndev-CommandAutocomplete)
